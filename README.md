# Spark IPython Notebooks  

This is a collection of IPython notebooks intended to train the reader
in different Spark concepts, from basic to advance, by using the Python
language.  

## Overview  


## Datasets  

We will be using datasets from the [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html).

## Notebooks  

1) [RDD creation](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jadianes/spark-py-notebooks/blob/master/nb1-rdd-creation/nb1-rdd-creation.ipynb): reading files and parallelize.  
2) RDDs basics: map, filter, collect.  
3) More on RDDs: the rest.  
4) Working with key-value pairs.
