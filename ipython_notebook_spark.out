2015-05-06 08:59:34.733 [NotebookApp] WARNING | Starting all kernels in pylab mode is not recommended,
    and will be disabled in a future release.
    Please use the %matplotlib magic to enable matplotlib instead.
    pylab implies many imports, which can have confusing side effects
    and harm the reproducibility of your notebooks.
